# Firebase Setup Guide

## Prerequisites ✅
- [x] Firebase CLI installed
- [x] FlutterFire CLI installed
- [ ] Firebase project created

---

## Step 1: Create Firebase Project (Manual)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click **"Add project"**
3. Enter project name: **"community-app"** (or your choice)
4. **Google Analytics:** Enable (recommended for tracking usage)
5. Click **"Create project"**
6. Wait for project creation (~30 seconds)

---

## Step 2: Enable Firebase Services (Manual)

Once your project is created:

### 2.1 Enable Authentication
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Build > Authentication**
2. Click **"Get started"**
3. Enable **Email/Password** sign-in
4. (Optional) Enable **Google** sign-in for social auth

### 2.2 Create Firestore Database
1. Go to **Build > Firestore Database**
2. Click **"Create database"**
3. Choose **"Start in test mode"** (we'll add security rules later)
4. Select location: Choose closest to your users (e.g., `us-central1`)
5. Click **"Enable"**

### 2.3 Enable Cloud Storage
1. Go to **Build > Storage**
2. Click **"Get started"**
3. Start in **test mode**
4. Use same location as Firestore
5. Click **"Done"**

### 2.4 Enable Cloud Messaging
1. Go to **Build > Cloud Messaging**
2. Click **"Get started"** (may be auto-enabled)

## Step 3: Configure Firebase in Flutter (Automated)

Once you've completed Steps 1-2 above, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
firebase login
```

This will:
1. Open a browser for authentication
2. Log you into Firebase CLI

Then run:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

This will:
1. Show you a list of your Firebase projects
2. Select **"community-app"** (or the name you chose)
3. Select platforms: **iOS** and **Android** (use arrow keys + space to select)
4. Press Enter
5. Automatically generate `firebase_options.dart` file
6. Configure iOS and Android projects

---

## Step 4: Verify Configuration

After running `flutterfire configure`, you should see:

✅ New file: `lib/firebase_options.dart`
✅ Updated: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
✅ Updated: `android/app/google-services.json`

---

## Step 5: Initialize Firebase in App

I'll update `main.dart` to initialize Firebase once you've completed the above steps.

---

## What to Do Next

**Complete the manual steps above (Steps 1-2), then tell me you're ready and I'll:**
1. Run `firebase login`
2. Run `flutterfire configure`
3. Update `main.dart` to initialize Firebase
4. Add Firestore security rules
5. Test the connection

---

## Expected Project Structure After Setup

```
community/
├── lib/
│   ├── firebase_options.dart     # ← Generated by flutterfire configure
│   └── ...
├── ios/
│   └── Runner/
│       └── GoogleService-Info.plist  # ← iOS config
├── android/
│   └── app/
│       └── google-services.json      # ← Android config
└── ...
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't find project"**
- Make sure you ran `firebase login` first
- Check you're logged in with the correct Google account

**"Permission denied"**
- Make sure you're an owner/editor of the Firebase project

**"Build failed"**
- Run `flutter clean`
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Try again

---

## Security Rules (I'll add these after configuration)

We'll set up proper security rules for:
- Authentication (only authenticated users)
- Firestore (read/write permissions)
- Storage (file upload permissions)
